# Interview for Red Atlas

This code is a simple single page form that takes in an ID and an amount. When the form is submitted, an api call is made to get a random user, The ID and amount then gets concatenated with the user's email, first and last names in an object. These users are displayed below the form as simple text.

Besides obvious style improvements to be made, this app could use some validation to make sure that the ID that is inputed is unique in our list of people, and that both the ID and amount fields can only be filled out with numerical values.

Thank you to Braian Fritz for taking the time to do this technical interview, and the whole Red Atlas team for your consideration.
